 <h1> Endangered Species <u> <i> </h1> </u> </i> 
<h2> Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.                                                                            A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about 65 million years ago. <p>
<h1> 10 Reasons Why Species Become Endangered </h1> 
 <h3>1. Overhunting or overharvesting <br>
2. Habitat loss <br>
3. High specialization<br>
4. Pollution<br>
5. Invasive species<br>
6. Human-wildlife conflict<br>
7. Disease<br>
8. Low birth rate<br>
9. Genetic vulnerability<br>
10. Small population<br>  </h3>                                   <H1>HumpbackWhales </H1>                                                                                                                                   <h3>Once hunted to the edge of extinction, humpback whales are finally increasing in numbers again. Most of populations of these gargantuan sea dwellers have been taken off the endangered species list, but they're far from in the clear. Humpback Whales, narrated by Ewan McGregor, examines these massive, majestic sea creatures, documenting the path that led to their near extinction and how they were saved.</h3>
